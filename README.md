Windower Addon: Displays active rolls, numbers and targets

This is an old, deprecated project, and my first experience working with Lua, APIs (Windower for FFXI), and writing a practical application.

RollCall was developed as a Windower addon that helped Corsairs keep track of current and active rolls on themselves and other party members, and the current numbers&mdash;as well as if they are "lucky" or "unlucky" rolls. As a dual- or tri-boxing Corsair that needed to switch parties and keep track of rolls and times on up to 17 other people, this application was a necessity for our linkshell in maintaining optimum buffs in high-intensity settings.
