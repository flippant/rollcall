Windower Addon: Displays active rolls, numbers and targets

This is an old, deprecated project, and my first experience working with Lua, APIs (Windower for FFXI), and writing a practical application. 

RollCall was developed as a Windower addon that helped Corsairs keep track of current and active rolls on themselves and other party members, and the current numbers&mdash;as well as if they are "lucky" or "unlucky" rolls. As a dual- or tri-boxing Corsair that needed to switch parties and keep track of rolls and times on up to 17 other people, this application was a necessity for our linkshell in maintaining optimum buffs in high-intensity settings.

Because my only previous experience before this was an object-oriented course using Java, I tried to incorporate those concepts when working on this project, only later understanding that the same structures did not apply so practically to the Lua language. Due to the decline of the Corsair role and the release of similar alternatives, this project was retired before I re-committed to completely redesigning it.
